# CIFAKE-image-classifiers
This repository forms the self-assigned *assignment 4* in the subject Visual Analytics, Cultural Data Science, F2023. The assignment description can be found here. All code is written by Mina Almasi (202005465) although some code may be adapted from classwork (see also [Code Reuse]()).

The repository contains code to train several classifiers on the [CIFAKE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images) dataset (Bird & Lofti, 2023). 


## Reproducibility 
To reproduce the results, follow the instructions in the [Pipeline]() section. 

NB! Be aware that training the model is computationally heavy. Cloud computing (e.g., UCloud) with high amounts of ram (or a good GPU) is encouraged.
